# VM Check

## Purpose
VM Check is a Perl script that can be used to see which settings still need to be changed in order to hide that you're running a Windows VM. When doing malware analysis, some malware samples will remove themselves if certain criteria hasn't been met. This is intended to give guidance on what might need to be changed in order to do Malware Analysis.

## Future improvements
[] Run commands to change hostname, user account, etc. to be changed to some random or preconfigured choices.
